### **What is Used Today (2025)?**
Zero-knowledge proofs are widely used in blockchain, privacy-preserving applications, and secure computation. **Plonk** is a leading zk-SNARK protocol, alongside Groth16 and STARKs. Below is the current landscape:

#### **1. Plonk**
- **Status**: Plonk (Permutations over Lagrange-bases for Oecumenical Noninteractive arguments of Knowledge, introduced in 2019) is a dominant zk-SNARK in 2025 due to its universal trusted setup and flexibility. It’s used in blockchain and privacy applications.
- **Current Usage**:
  - **Blockchain**: Powers Layer 2 solutions like **zkSync** and **Polygon zkEVM** for scalable, private transactions in zero-knowledge rollups.
  - **Cross-Chain**: Used in protocols like **Polyhedr’s zkBridge** for trustless cross-chain communication.
  - **Custom Circuits**: Supports application-specific circuits (e.g., proving preimage knowledge) due to custom gates and lookup tables (via Plookup).
  - **Variants**: Optimized versions like **Plonky2** (Polygon) and **Halo2** (Mina Protocol) offer faster proving and recursion support.
- **Mathematical Foundation**:
  - Uses a permutation-based constraint system with gate constraints:
    \[
    q_L \cdot a + q_R \cdot b + q_O \cdot c + q_M \cdot (a \cdot b) + q_C = 0
    \]
    and copy constraints for wire consistency.
  - Relies on **KZG polynomial commitments** for efficient proofs, requiring five polynomial commitments and two opening proofs.
  - Verification checks polynomial identities at a random point \( \zeta \):
    \[
    [F(X)]_1 = [T(X)]_1 \cdot [Z(X)]_1
    \]
    where \( [.]_1 \) denotes elliptic curve group commitments, with blinding for zero-knowledge.
- **Why Popular?**:
  - Universal trusted setup: One setup for all circuits up to a size limit (e.g., \( 2^{28} \) gates).
  - Prover time ~23 seconds for million-gate circuits, compact SRS.
  - Expressive for complex circuits via custom gates and lookup tables.

#### **2. Groth16**
- **Status**: Widely used in legacy systems and gas-sensitive applications (e.g., Zcash) due to its efficiency, but less common for new projects due to circuit-specific trusted setups.
- **Current Usage**:
  - Legacy blockchain protocols and Ethereum applications requiring minimal proof size.
- **Mathematical Foundation**:
  - Uses Rank-1 Constraint System (R1CS):
    \[
    A \cdot B + C = 0
    \]
  - Verification via a single pairing:
    \[
    e(A, B) = e(\alpha, \beta) \cdot e(\gamma, C) \cdot e(\delta, D)
    \]
    where \( e \) is a bilinear pairing.
- **Why Used?**:
  - Smallest proofs (~128-256 bytes) and fastest verification (~1-2 ms).
  - Mature tooling (e.g., `snarkjs`, `circomlib`).

#### **3. STARKs**
- **Status**: Growing for applications needing no trusted setup or post-quantum security, used in **StarkNet** and **Valida**.
- **Current Usage**:
  - **StarkNet**: Layer 2 solution for scalable Ethereum computation.
  - **Valida**: STARK-based zkVM for customizable virtual machines.
- **Mathematical Foundation**:
  - Uses Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR) with polynomial tables.
  - Relies on **FRI (Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proofs)** for transparent commitments.
  - Larger proofs (~10-100 KB) but quantum-resistant.
- **Why Used?**:
  - No trusted setup.
  - Scalable for large circuits, though slower verification.

### **Circom Context**
Since you referenced Circom previously, Plonk is increasingly preferred in Circom-based workflows:
- **Circom** supports Plonk and Groth16 via `snarkjs`. Plonk’s gate-based constraints align well with Circom’s arithmetic circuits.
- Example Plonk compilation for a circuit:
```x-shellscript
#!/bin/bash
circom circuit.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym
snarkjs plonk setup circuit.r1cs powersOfTau28_hez_final.ptau circuit.zkey
```

### **What’s Dominant in 2025?**
- **Plonk** (and variants like Plonky2, Halo2): Preferred for new blockchain projects (e.g., zkSync, Polygon zkEVM) due to universal setup, flexibility, and expressiveness.
- **Groth16**: Used in legacy systems for efficiency.
- **STARKs**: Growing for trustless, quantum-resistant applications (e.g., StarkNet).
