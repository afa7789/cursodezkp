To address your question about **Plonk** vs. **Groth16** in the context of **Tornado Cash** and **Circom** (since you previously asked about Tornado Cash and Circom circuits), I’ll compare these two zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) systems, explain their differences, and clarify their relevance to Tornado Cash. I’ll keep it concise, technical, and focused on your request, integrating the context of Circom and Tornado Cash where relevant. I’ll also address the "mathematical formula" aspect from your previous question by explaining the mathematical underpinnings of both systems.

### **Overview: Plonk vs. Groth16**
**Plonk** and **Groth16** are zk-SNARK (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) protocols used to prove the correctness of computations (like those defined in Circom circuits) without revealing private inputs. Tornado Cash originally used **Groth16** for its zk-SNARKs, as it was the standard at the time of its deployment, but newer systems (including potential upgrades or similar protocols) have explored **Plonk** due to its advantages. Below, I’ll compare them across key dimensions.

---

### **1. Groth16**
**Groth16** (introduced by Jens Groth in 2016) is a highly efficient zk-SNARK protocol widely used in early ZKP applications like Tornado Cash.

#### **Key Features**
- **Trusted Setup**: Requires a circuit-specific trusted setup (Structured Reference String, SRS) for each circuit. This generates proving and verification keys, but if the setup is compromised (e.g., "toxic waste" is not destroyed), the system’s security is at risk.
- **Efficiency**: Extremely fast proof generation (~100-200 ms) and verification (~1-2 ms) for small circuits, with small proof sizes (~128-256 bytes).
- **Circuit Specificity**: Each circuit (e.g., Tornado Cash’s `Withdraw` circuit) needs its own trusted setup. Changing the circuit requires a new setup.
- **Mathematical Structure**:
  - Uses a **Rank-1 Constraint System (R1CS)**, where the circuit is expressed as constraints of the form \( A \cdot B + C = 0 \).
  - The proof relies on pairing-based cryptography over elliptic curves (e.g., BN128).
  - The prover demonstrates knowledge of a witness \( w \) satisfying the circuit’s constraints, encoded as a polynomial evaluation in the SRS.
  - Core equation for verification (simplified):
    \[
    e(A, B) = e(\alpha, \beta) \cdot e(\gamma, C) \cdot e(\delta, D)
    \]
    where \( e \) is a bilinear pairing, and \( A, B, C, D \) are elements derived from the witness and SRS.
- **Use in Tornado Cash**: Tornado Cash’s `Withdraw.circom` circuit (as shown in the previous response) is compiled into R1CS for Groth16. The circuit proves that a withdrawal is valid (commitment in Merkle tree, nullifier unused) using a Groth16 proof verified on-chain.

#### **Pros**
- Highly optimized for performance (fastest verification among zk-SNARKs).
- Small proof sizes, ideal for Ethereum’s gas constraints.
- Well-tested and widely used (e.g., Zcash, Tornado Cash).

#### **Cons**
- Circuit-specific trusted setup is a security risk and logistical burden (requires a new ceremony per circuit).
- Inflexible: Modifying the circuit (e.g., adding a new feature to Tornado Cash) requires a new trusted setup.
- Limited to R1CS, which can be less expressive for complex circuits.

### **2. Plonk**
**Plonk** (Permutations over Lagrange-bases for Oecumenical Noninteractive arguments of Knowledge, introduced in 2019) is a more modern zk-SNARK protocol designed to address Groth16’s limitations.

#### **Key Features**
- **Universal Trusted Setup**: Requires only one trusted setup for *all circuits* up to a certain size (e.g., \( 2^{28} \) constraints). This SRS is reusable across different circuits, making it more flexible.
- **Efficiency**: Slightly slower than Groth16 (proof generation ~300-500 ms, verification ~3-5 ms), with slightly larger proofs (~200-300 bytes).
- **Circuit Flexibility**: Supports a broader class of circuits using a **permutation-based constraint system** (not strictly R1CS). It can handle both arithmetic circuits and custom gates more easily.
- **Mathematical Structure**:
  - Uses a **polynomial commitment scheme** (e.g., KZG commitments) to encode the circuit’s constraints.
  - The circuit is expressed as a set of polynomial equations, with constraints defined via **copy constraints** (permutations) and **gate constraints**.
  - Core idea: The prover constructs polynomials representing the circuit’s inputs, outputs, and gates, and proves their consistency using the KZG scheme.
  - Simplified verification equation:
    \[
    [F(X)]_1 = [T(X)]_1 \cdot [Z(X)]_1
    \]
    where \( F, T, Z \) are polynomials evaluated at a random point, and \( [.]_1 \) denotes a commitment in the elliptic curve group.
  - Plonk’s permutation argument ensures that wires (signals) in the circuit are correctly connected, replacing R1CS’s stricter structure.
- **Use in Tornado Cash**: Tornado Cash’s original implementation used Groth16 due to its maturity at the time (circa 2020). However, newer protocols or forks (e.g., post-2023 privacy solutions) could adapt Tornado Cash’s `Withdraw` circuit to Plonk by recompiling it with a Plonk-compatible backend (e.g., using `circom` with `snarkjs` Plonk support). The circuit logic (hashing, Merkle proof, nullifier) remains the same, but Plonk’s universal setup simplifies deployment.

#### **Pros**
- Universal trusted setup is reusable, reducing setup overhead and security risks.
- More flexible: Supports circuit changes without new setups.
- Supports custom gates and more expressive constraints, making it easier to write complex circuits.
- Compatible with modern tools like `circom` (via `snarkjs` Plonk backend).

#### **Cons**
- Slightly slower and larger proofs than Groth16.
- More complex implementation, less battle-tested than Groth16 in early deployments.
- Higher memory requirements for proof generation.

### **Plonk vs. Groth16 in Tornado Cash**
- **Tornado Cash’s Choice (Groth16)**:
  - Tornado Cash used Groth16 because it was the most efficient and mature zk-SNARK protocol when the project launched (~2019-2020).
  - The `Withdraw.circom` circuit (as shown previously) was compiled into R1CS, and a circuit-specific trusted setup was performed (Web ID: 7, 17).
  - Groth16’s small proof size and fast verification were critical for Ethereum’s high gas costs, ensuring low-cost on-chain verification.
  - Downside: Each denomination (e.g., 1 ETH, 10 ETH) required a separate trusted setup, increasing setup complexity.

- **Could Tornado Cash Use Plonk?**
  - Yes, Tornado Cash’s circuit could be adapted for Plonk. The `Withdraw.circom` circuit’s logic (MiMCSponge hashing, Merkle proof, nullifier check) is compatible with Plonk’s constraint system.
  - Benefits of Plonk for Tornado Cash:
    - Single trusted setup for all denominations (e.g., 1 ETH, 10 ETH circuits).
    - Easier to update the circuit (e.g., add new features like multi-recipient withdrawals) without a new setup.
    - Potentially better for larger circuits if Tornado Cash were extended (e.g., more complex anonymity sets).
  - Downsides:
    - Slightly higher gas costs due to larger proof sizes and slower verification.
    - Plonk was less mature during Tornado Cash’s peak development, so Groth16 was the safer choice.

- **Practical Example**:
  - To use Plonk, you’d recompile `Withdraw.circom` with `snarkjs` using the Plonk backend:
    ```bash
    circom Withdraw.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym
    snarkjs plonk setup Withdraw.r1cs powersOfTau28_hez_final.ptau Withdraw.zkey
    ```
    - The resulting `.zkey` uses a universal SRS (e.g., `powersOfTau28_hez_final.ptau`), reusable across circuits.
    - The smart contract would be updated to verify Plonk proofs (using a Plonk verifier contract).

---

### **Mathematical Formula Comparison**
Both protocols rely on elliptic curve cryptography and polynomial commitments, but their constraint systems and proof structures differ:

1. **Groth16 (R1CS)**:
   - Circuit constraints: \( A \cdot B + C = 0 \), where \( A, B, C \) are linear combinations of signals.
   - Proof generation: The prover constructs polynomials for the witness and evaluates them in the SRS.
   - Verification: Checks a single pairing equation involving the proof and public inputs.
   - Example for Tornado Cash’s `commitment = MiMCSponge(nullifier, secret)`:
     - MiMCSponge is broken into R1CS constraints (e.g., for each round of the hash function).
     - Total constraints: ~10,000-20,000 for a typical Tornado Cash circuit (depends on Merkle tree depth).

2. **Plonk (Permutation-Based)**:
   - Circuit constraints: Defined via gate constraints (e.g., \( q_L \cdot a + q_R \cdot b + q_O \cdot c + q_M \cdot (a \cdot b) + q_C = 0 \)) and copy constraints (permutations ensuring wire consistency).
   - Proof generation: The prover constructs polynomials for inputs, outputs, and permutations, committed via KZG.
   - Verification: Checks polynomial identities at a random point, using multiple pairing checks.
   - For Tornado Cash: The same `Withdraw.circom` circuit would be expressed with Plonk’s gate constraints, with similar constraint counts but more flexibility in structure.

### **Why Tornado Cash Used Groth16**
- **Historical Context**: Groth16 was the dominant zk-SNARK in 2019-2020, with mature tooling (`snarkjs`, `circomlib`).
- **Efficiency**: Groth16’s smaller proofs and faster verification minimized Ethereum gas costs, critical for a mixer like Tornado Cash.
- **Trusted Setup**: Tornado Cash conducted secure multi-party computation (MPC) ceremonies for each denomination, mitigating setup risks (Web ID: 7).

### **Could Plonk Be Used?**
- Modern implementations of privacy protocols (post-2023) often prefer Plonk for its universal setup and flexibility. For Tornado Cash, Plonk would simplify deployment across multiple denominations and future upgrades, but it would slightly increase gas costs.

---

### **Conclusion**
**Groth16** was ideal for Tornado Cash due to its efficiency and maturity at the time, using R1CS constraints for the `Withdraw.circom` circuit. **Plonk** offers a more flexible alternative with a universal trusted setup, making it suitable for modernizing Tornado Cash or similar protocols. Mathematically, Groth16 relies on R1CS and pairing checks, while Plonk uses permutation-based constraints and KZG commitments.
